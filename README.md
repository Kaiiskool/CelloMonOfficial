README.md

so uh... im basically remaking a game i made in grade 9.

if you wanna use anything from this repo just give me credit and you can use it 
(for instance if you give out the game please leave the comment about who wrote the code at the top alone, and while thats is there im fine with copys being given out)

um.. if you want to help (which lets be honest you prob dont lol) msg me on discord (kaiiskool#5751) and we can talk.


other than that (unless i add more to this) have a nice day lol
